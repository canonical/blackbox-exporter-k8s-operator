        Blackbox Exporter configuration file (yaml).
        Refer to https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md for
        full details.
        The modules provided via blackbox_exporter_probes interface are merged with the modules defined here.

        Refer to https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter#prometheus-configuration for full
        details.
        The probes provided via blackbox_exporter_probes interface are merged with the probes defined here.
        The relation probes are hashed to ensure uniquess in the blackbox_probes.py library.
        However, in case of same `job_name` the relation probe takes precedence,
        overriding the corresponding file probe.
    cpu:

        K8s cpu resource limit, e.g. "1" or "500m". Default is unset (no limit). This value is used
        for the "limits" portion of the resource requirements (the "requests" portion is
        automatically deduced from it).
