provides:
  self-metrics-endpoint:
    interface: prometheus_scrape
    optional: true
    description: |
      Exposes the Prometheus metrics endpoint providing telemetry about the Blackbox instance.
  grafana-dashboard:
    interface: grafana_dashboard
    optional: true
    description: |
      Forwards the built-in Grafana dashboard(s) for monitoring Blackbox.


requires:
  logging:
    interface: loki_push_api
    optional: true
    description: |
      Receives Loki's push api endpoint address to push logs to, and forwards charm's built-in alert rules to Loki.
  ingress:
    interface: ingress
    optional: true
    limit: 1
    description: |
      Ingress integration for Blackbox exporter, so that it can be reached by a
      cross-model Prometheus instance. The workload can send logs to
      Loki through the ingress.
  catalogue:
    interface: catalogue
    optional: true
    description: Add Alertmanager as an item to a Catalogue charm.
  probes:
    interface: blackbox_exporter_probes
    optional: true
    description: |
          Receive a list of probes (server address and probing method) from the provider to query.

        Blackbox Exporter configuration file (yaml).
        Refer to https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md for
        full details.
        The modules provided via blackbox_exporter_probes interface are merged with the modules defined here.
    probes_file:
      type: string
      default: ""
      description: >
        Scrape config for Prometheus in a file (yaml).
        Refer to https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter#prometheus-configuration for full
        details.
        The probes provided via blackbox_exporter_probes interface are merged with the probes defined here.
        The relation probes are hashed to ensure uniquess in the blackbox_probes.py library.
        However, in case of same `job_name` the relation probe takes precedence,
        overriding the corresponding file probe.
    cpu:
      description: |
        K8s cpu resource limit, e.g. "1" or "500m". Default is unset (no limit). This value is used
        for the "limits" portion of the resource requirements (the "requests" portion is
        automatically deduced from it).

    memory:
      description: |
        K8s memory resource limit, e.g. "1Gi". Default is unset (no limit). This value is used
